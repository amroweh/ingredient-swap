# ingredient-swap

This project contains the code files for the manipulation of the AllRecipes recipe and ingredient databases, along with their GHG emissions and Land Use Values.

Additionally, the project also has the flavour database.

The purpose of this program is to attempt to link all these characteristics together in order to be able to swap ingredients with high GHG emissions with those of lower emissions.
